# PC-Assemble
PC assembly activity was conducted in the N28 Level 3 laboratory room on 6/11/2024 (Wed) . Students were required to worked in groups of six with the guidance of technicians who taught us the steps of disassembling a PC. Afterward, we were tasked with reassembling the PC ourselves in group.

The assembly process involved several steps: 
1. First, place the CPU fan on top of the CPU and secure it with screws using a screwdriver. 
2. Next, install the hard disk properly.



3. Then, insert the RAM into the motherboard.



4. Press it firmly until a "click" sound confirms it is securely in place. 
5. Install the power supply unit by screwing it into position.



6. Afterward, connect all necessary cables to the motherboard, hard disks, and power supply unit. 
7. Once the components are in place, close the case. 
8. Finally, connect the PC to a monitor to verify its functionality.

With the monitor successfully turning on, we confirmed our assembly was correct and were the first group to complete it. Here I provide the name of the components and its corresponding functions: 

|Component | Function|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CPU (Central Processing Unit  | the brain of the computer and is located on the motherboard.  |
| CPU fan  | To keep the CPU cool  |
| RAM (Random Access Memory)  | A temporary memory to store data and instructions for active tasks while the computer is in use  |
| Hard disk  | stores data and information permanently  |
| Power supply unit  | provides the necessary electricity to power all components |
| Cables  | connect the components, so that the components can communicate and work together effectively  |

Through this activity, I gained hands-on experience in assembling and disassembling a PC. Besides, I also developed a better understanding of each component's function, which contributes to the overall operation of a computer.
