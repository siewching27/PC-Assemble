PC assembly activity was conducted in the N28 Level 3 laboratory room on 6/11/2024 (Wed) . Students were required to worked in groups of six with the guidance of technicians who taught us the steps of disassembling a PC. Afterward, we were tasked with reassembling the PC ourselves in group.

The assembly process involved several steps: 
1. First, place the CPU fan on top of the CPU and secure it with screws using a screwdriver. 
2. Next, install the hard disk properly.   
3. Then, insert the RAM into the motherboard. 
4. Press it firmly until a "click" sound confirms it is securely in place. 
5. Install the power supply unit by screwing it into position. 
6. Afterward, connect all necessary cables to the motherboard, hard disks, and power supply unit. 
7. Once the components are in place, close the case. 
8. Finally, connect the PC to a monitor to verify its functionality.

With the monitor successfully turning on, we confirmed our assembly was correct and were the first group to complete it. This experience provided a valuable opportunity to build hands-on skills and a better understanding of PC components and assembly.
