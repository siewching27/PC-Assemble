# 💻PC-Assemble

🗓️ Details of the Activity<br>
📍 Location: N28 Level 3 Laboratory Room<br>
📅 Date: 6th November 2024 (Wednesday)<br>
👥 Group Size: 6 Students


The assembly process involved several steps: <br>
1️⃣ First, place the ❄️CPU fan on top of the 🧠CPU and secure it with screws using a screwdriver.<br> 
2️⃣ Next, install the hard disk properly.

4️⃣ Press it firmly until a "click" sound confirms it is securely in place. <br>
5️⃣ Install the power supply unit by screwing it into position.

6️⃣ Afterward, connect all necessary cables to the motherboard, hard disks, and power supply unit. <br>
7️⃣ Once the components are in place, close the case. <br>
8️⃣ Finally, connect the PC to a monitor to verify its functionality.<br>

With the monitor successfully turning on, we confirmed our assembly was correct and were the **first group** to complete it. 🎉

<h3>🛠️ **PC Components and Their Functions**</h3>

|Component | Function|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CPU (Central Processing Unit  | the brain of the computer and is located on the motherboard.  |
| CPU fan  | To keep the CPU cool  |
| RAM (Random Access Memory)  | A temporary memory to store data and instructions for active tasks while the computer is in use  |
| Hard disk  | stores data and information permanently  |
| Power supply unit  | provides the necessary electricity to power all components |
| Cables  | connect the components, so that the components can communicate and work together effectively  |

<h3>💡Reflection</h3>

Through this activity, I gained hands-on experience in assembling and disassembling a PC. Besides, I also developed a better understanding of each component's function, which contributes to the overall operation of a computer. Before this experience, I only knew how to use the system software inside a computer and was unaware of how each hardware component contributed to making it work. I now realize that I took hardware for granted, knowing little about its importance beyond basic peripherals like the keyboard and monitor 🤔.

This activity gave me a deeper understanding of the critical interconnection between hardware and software. If anything goes wrong with the hardware, the software cannot function properly. Thus, I now understand the importance of taking good care of hardware components to ensure their longevity and overall efficiency. For instance, I will protect my system from potential threats such as physical damage, power surges, and infected USB drives to ensure that my hardware remains secure and reliable.
